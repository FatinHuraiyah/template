      <h1>Communications in Chemical Engineering</h1>
      <p style="color:#2E2E2E; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">In her interview, Dr. Chong Mee Yoke, who has 10-year experience in Chemical Engineering in INTI International University, explains about the communication that commonly occurs in Chemical Engineering.</p>
        <div style="margin-left: 8em;color:#2E2E2E; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">"Chemical engineers need to be able to know how to speak fluently especially in universal language, that is understood worldwide, for example English. This is because chemical engineers usually do partnership with other engineers in different parts of the world and they need to know how to communicate with each other when working on a project. Besides that, writing is as crucial. Chemical engineers write tons and tons of reports and papers. Developing these skills can really help to boost your career."</div>
      <p style="color:#2E2E2E; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">In another interview with Mr. Mohammad Nazroon Hardika, who is a chemical engineer that is currently working with PETRONAS, the biggest Malaysian oil company, when ask about toughest part of his job, he answered, "I think the toughest part is when I have to communicate and work with people from the Marketing and Sales part of the company because I find it hard to make them understand what I understand as the approach that we use to overcome problems is very different." </p>
      <p style="color:#2E2E2E; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">From those two answers given by the interviewees, it is proven that communication skills play significant role in Chemical Engineering either in class environment or work environment. Collaborations with other professions are also needed and this may cause a problem when the chemical engineer does not have good communication skills.</p>
      <p style="color:#2E2E2E; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">Communications skills, which includes both writing and speaking skills occurs commonly in Chemical Engineering. Reading skill which compliments reading skill is inevitable in Chemical Engineering. These skills are important to chemical engineers because chemical engineers must be able to describe, analyze and present their findings in both written and oral reports. The communication skills of chemical engineers intensify as they advance to management jobs, start their own business or enter a graduate school. In general, technological literacies are more common than rhetorical literacies in Chemical Engineering. This is because chemical engineers emphasize more on presenting the data in most easy and simplified context possible. They take language as a tool only to deliver information and nothing more. </p>
      <p style="color:#2E2E2E; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">The most common documents written by all chemical engineer is technical laboratory reports and technical papers. The sole purpose of the technical laboratory reports is to present interpretation of results from laboratory experiments to managers, directors and other professional colleagues; whereas the purpose of technical paper is to present findings which result from researches conducted by chemical engineers. Clear and concise language must be used in order to present these reports and papers. Technical terms are widely used in the reports and paper which is why they are called technical report and paper. Both technical report and paper must adhere to specific format. This is a very efficient way to communicate when a chemical engineer is trying to present analysis on data as the reader will have more time and can understand the analysis better by reading than speaking about it as some information may be understood or forgotten throughout the oral communication. </p>
      <p style="color:#2E2E2E; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">Another way of communication in Chemical Engineering is by responding to an article that may be a scholarly article or a popular article. Scholarly article are more common in Chemical Engineering than popular article. The respond can be done in written or oral form and is known as literature review. As for chemical engineers, the literature review is commonly done in written form as the review is very thorough and contains a lot of information to be digested at once if presented orally. After a chemical engineer reads of an article written by another chemical engineer, the reader will have an opinion which may support or against the article, then the reader will write or present a literature review which will argue or support the finding in the article by using his or her own finding or research. This is an indirect way of communication between the author and reader as there are more than the two involves in the argument because since it is done publicly, public can also view the article and the literature review and have their own thoughts.</p>
      <p style="color:#2E2E2E; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">Writing proposals is the common way used by chemical engineers to communicate with other professions. Chemical engineers need financial support to fund their research and writing proposal is the way chemical engineers can achieve it. Chemical engineers may also write proposal to convince a company to hire them to complete a project. They persuade the client by presenting the problem and solutions to the problem in timely and economic manner. The proposal is usually done together with an oral presentation. The oral presentation is to further solidify the issue that they are presenting and where any question the client has will be answered. If the client is satisfied by their approach in solving the problem, the client will agree to hire or give financial support to the presenting chemical engineers. </p>
      <p style="color:#2E2E2E; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">Reading, writing and speaking are all commonly used in Chemical Engineering to present data and communicate with other people regardless if they are chemical engineers or not. This is because in order for chemical engineers to achieve their motives, they need help from other professions too.  This is why collaborations have been made by chemical engineers with other professions for either research purposes or career purposes. </p>
      <p style="color:#2E2E2E; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">Figure 2 below shows the importance of communication skill in comparison to other skills in Chemical Engineering discipline:</p>
