		        <h5 style="color:#0B173B; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri"><em>08.29.2013</em></h5>	        
			        <p style="color:#1C1C1C; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">This is the first day of my writing class in MSU. I am already very nervous about finding my way to Bessey Hall. It is my first semester in MSU and I am still unfamiliar of all the bus numbers and routes. And as expected I am late for class. I do not know what hybrid class means until the instructor gives some brief explanation about this course.  I cannot focus on what the instructor is saying because I am still sweating from all the running I did to the class. It's only the first class but the instructor is already giving the first assignment. Although she said to take easy on this class but I am not so sure about that because it seems like there are so many things to be done every week. But I believe I can survive all this as long as I prepare myself ahead! Welcome to university life to me!</p>
			      <h5 style="color:#0B173B; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri"><em>09.05.2013</em></h5>	        
			        <p style="color:#1C1C1C; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">Today is the second class and I finally know the fastest route to class. I have decided to cycle to class from now on. Today, the instructor explains about all the websites and tools that we will be using throughout the semester. There are just too many of them that I have to bookmark and write everything in my note book just to make sure that I will not forger. I try my best following what she explains but it is really hard because I have to listen, understand and write at the same time. She shows the class which website is for uploading assignments, peer reviews, learn html and css codes and view the schedule. She guides us to upload the draft of the first assignment.  Today is also the day I meet Lihan and he makes me feel less nervous as now I know I'm not the only one clueless in the class. Coincidently we are peer review partner of each other. </p>
			      <h5 style="color:#0B173B; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri"><em>09.12.2013</em></h5>	        
			        <p style="color:#1C1C1C; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">Today, the instructor has given us the first in-class activity. The purpose of this activity is to help the students to understand more about narrative writing since most of us wrote essay writing instead on narrative writing for the Lived Experience Project. As a result, Dr. Christie L. Daniels has asked us to write a review on the video she has showed us today.  Nothing much can be done in class since most of the time is allocated for watching the video. The summary of the activity can be found in the 'In-Class Activity 1' tab. The Lived Experiences Project is due next week but I have decided to finish it during the weekends.</p>
			     <h5 style="color:#0B173B; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri"><em>09.19.2013</em></h5>	        
			        <p style="color:#1C1C1C; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">I am very happy that I have finished my Lived Experience Project earlier. Most of my friends have not finished theirs and they are very worried. Today, the instructor gives brief explanation about the second assignment, which is the Cultural Analysis Project. I am looking forward to this second assignment.  I already have in mind what I want to write for my Cultural Analysis Project. It seems like I am getting hang of this course. I have started my Codecademy too and I am really enjoying it. I am planning to finish it as early as possible because all the skills that I learned from the website will be very useful for creating my website later on. Now I am really pump up for the second assignment!</p>
			    <h5 style="color:#0B173B; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri"><em>09.26.2013</em></h5>	        
			        <p style="color:#1C1C1C; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">The instructor is sick so the class is cancelled.</p>
			     <h5 style="color:#0B173B; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri"><em>10.03.2013</em></h5>	        
			        <p style="color:#1C1C1C; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">The instructor gives us the second in-class assignment today. We are required to do a film review and answer some questions given by the instructor regarding the movie. We spend our time watching 'The Social Network'. Since the film is quite long, we cannot finish watching the movie today and decide to continue watching the remaining part next week. The summary of the activity can be found in the 'In-Class Activity 2' tab.</p>
			      <h5 style="color:#0B173B; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri"><em>10.10.2013</em></h5>	        
			        <p style="color:#1C1C1C; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">Today, we watch the remaining part of 'The Social Network' that we cannot finish last week. The instructor gives us the remaining time to finish up our Cultural Analysis Project. It is really kind of her to do so as many of the students have not finished their project yet. As for me, I have finished mine during the weekends so I spend the remaining time polishing up my website.</p>
			      <h5 style="color:#0B173B; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri"><em>10.17.2013</em></h5>	        
			        <p style="color:#1C1C1C; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">It has become my new habit to come 30 minutes early to class nowadays. It is to allow me to settle down and set up my lap top before the class start. Besides that, I have my favorite sit now that I wish to reserve for every class. So far I have made few more friends in the class. Many of them are really friendly. Lihan and Joshua always sit by me nowadays. Today, after we upload our Cultural Analysis Project, we listen to lecture the instructor have given us on Emig and Brummett articles. After the lecture, we have to do a library activity that is due by midnight. The instructor gives us a brief description about the third assignment which is the Formal Research Project and how the library activity will help us for the third assignment. Lihan, Joshua and I did ours together during the class. We have decided to stay a bit later just to finish the library activity before leaving. </p>
			      <h5 style="color:#0B173B; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri"><em>10.24.2013</em></h5>	        
			        <p style="color:#1C1C1C; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">The formal project is very tedious. There is so much stuff to do. I am very worried about the interviews. I do not know anyone professional that I can interview for. Today, the instructor gives us the class time for us to continue on working with the Formal Research Assignment. Lihan, Joshua and I spend our time complaining about the project and hard it is to figure out what to write for the third assignment. Finally, we figure out that nothing much will result from complaining and we start to brainstorm about the third assignment. By the end of class, I have decided that I will interview my lecturer from my hometown and my brother's friend for the third assignment. I am really happy that at least I have something to work on now!</p>
			      <h5 style="color:#0B173B; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri"><em>10.31.2013</em></h5>	        
			        <p style="color:#1C1C1C; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">Today is Halloween day!  I am in no mood for class and I just want to head back to prepare for Halloween tonight! Thank god that there is not much stuff to do in class except to continue on working on the Formal Research Project.  After the class Lihan, Joshua and I discuss about our plan for Halloween that night.</p>
			      <h5 style="color:#0B173B; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri"><em>11.07.2013</em></h5>	        
			        <p style="color:#1C1C1C; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">After a really hectic week, I have managed to finish my Formal Research Project before its due date. Today the instructor has given us some brief description on our new assignment which is the Multimedia Remix Project. It is a group project and it feels really natural to do it with Lihan and Joshua since we have gotten really close now. Just to give a clear idea on what video making is about, the instructor has showed us many advertisements as examples. After that she gives us our third in-class activity which is a review on Chrysler 300 advertisement.  The summary of the activity can be found in the 'In-Class Activity 3' tab. We spend the remaining time choosing a topic for our Multimedia Remix Project. We also discuss about meeting up outside of class to complete the proposal for the current assignment which is due next week.</p>
			      <h5 style="color:#0B173B; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri"><em>11.14.2013</em></h5>	        
			        <p style="color:#1C1C1C; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">Our instructor decides to make some change that is postponing the due date of the Multimedia Remix Project till after Thanksgiving but in return for that, we have to start working simultaneously for our final project which is the Final Retrospective Project. So today, the instructor briefs us on the final assignment. We barely finish our proposal before the due date. Lihan, Joshua and I have decided to focus the project on Lihan's Cultural Analysis Project which is about the effect of cell phones on in-person communication. We spend the remaining time of the class discussing about what we want to do and division of work. We also try to find suitable time to do the video and interview recording for the documentary. By the end of class, I have so much stuff on my to-do list that has to be done before the Thanksgiving.</p>
			      <h5 style="color:#0B173B; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri"><em>11.21.2013</em></h5>	        
			        <p style="color:#1C1C1C; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">Today, after sharing our drafts of the Final Retrospective Project on a forum in D2L, we have to decide which group we want to be for the final assignment. I have decided to be in the content group which is the Formal Research Project Content group. I am not in the same group as Lihan and Joshua as their group is already full. Regardless of that, my new group seems really reliable and I am glad that I am in that group. We have decided to divide up the workload and post each individual part on the google document. This makes our jobs much easier since we do not have to meet up to do the work. I am still very worried because the documentary process still has not started and now I have another project to handle. It seems like my Thanksgiving holiday will not be very pleasant now. </p>
			      <h5 style="color:#0B173B; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri"><em>11.28.2013</em></h5>	        
			        <p style="color:#1C1C1C; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">There is no class. It is Thanksgiving holidays!!!</p>
			      <h5 style="color:#0B173B; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri"><em>12.05.2013</em></h5>	        
			        <p style="color:#1C1C1C; text-indent:5em; text-align:justify; font-size:20px; font-family:calibri">It is the last class of the semester. After some rough week, we finally finish our documentary and it is ready to be submitted. Since it is the last class, the instructor explains in detail about what is due and by when. The remaining time of the class is spent on the Final Retrospective Project. Since my group has finished our part, I do not have much stuff to do except uploading all the remaining assignments.  The website team seems really busy since they are the one who will compile everything and put it on the website for the Final Retrospective Project. They have asked us to take pictures according to groups that they will post on the website. After the photo session, I have decided to go back. Now all I have to worry is finishing up my website and upload it as soon as possible! Finally writing class is over. I am quite sad though, since it will be hard for me to meet up with the friends I have met throughout the semester. Most of us are from different majors. But I hope to keep few ones close by, maybe we can go watch some football match together during the winter break.  WRA 110 is officially over!</p>
