			<h1>about me</h1>
			<p>As obvious as can be seen, my name is Fatin Huraiyah Pathi. Fatin Huraiyah is my first name and Pathi is my last name. People get confused a lot by that and I don't really know why.</p>
			<p>I come from Malaysia which is a really small country compared to the United States, maybe its size is equivalent to just one medium-sized state in the United states.</p>
			<p>Basic things about me? That is if you are interested to know. Here goes, I'm 20 years old and I'm majoring in chemical engineering. Although this is my first semester in MSU, I'm currently in my junior year.</p>
			<p> My hobby involves anything outdoor! So basically i love adventerous stuff!</p>
			<p> I guess that's all! Nice to meet you and have a great day ahead!!!</p>
